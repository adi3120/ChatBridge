1. Can you define DBMS

A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data 
a set of programs to access those data. 

The collection of data, usually referred to as the database,
contains information relevant to an enterprise. 

provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.

A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality.

perform different operations like 
	addition
	access
	updating
	deletion
of the data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Importance of database management
File-processing systems has major disadvantages.
i. Data Redundancy and inconsistency
ii. Difficulty in accessing data
iii. Data isolation
iv. Integrity problems
v. Atomicity problems
vi. Concurrent-access anomalies
vii. Security problems

DBMS Advantages
efficient processing
efficient accessing
ACID properties
	Atomicity
	Consistency
	Integrity
	Durability
Security
structure
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Difference between RDBMS and DBMS

RDBMS
consists of collection of tables, 
each of which is assigned a unique name.
A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values, and table is collection of such relationships.
Row -> tuple
Column -> attribute
Table -> entity
Domain -> set/range of values for a attribute/column
Eg Age -> 1 - 100
   name -> strings
Schema -> structure/skeleton/blueprint of table
schema -> columns
Relational schema -> structure
		     Name of relation
		     columns
eg Oracle, IBM, MySQL, MS Access
Degree -> Number of columns
Cardinality -> Total tuples
Relational key -> set of attributes to uniquely identify each tuple
Values should be atomic -> non divisible
sequence dosnt matter
follow integrity constraints
Software that enable us to implement designed relational model.
Table/Relation is the simplest form of data storage object in R-DB.
MySQL is open-source RDBMS, and it uses SQL for all CRUD operations

DBMS
DBMS stores data as file.
Data elements need to access individually.
DBMS does not support distributed database.
It deals with small quantity of data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. what is SQL
SQL: Structured Query Language, used to access and manipulate data.
CRUD with DB
SQL is not DB, is a query language	
MySQL used client-server model, where client is CLI or frontend that used services provided by MySQL server
MYSQL -> RDBMS
SQL -> language
Size: TINY < SMALL < MEDIUM < INT < BIGINT.
Query optimisation
Data processing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. what does PLSQL stand for
PL/SQL is Oracle's procedural language extension to SQL. 
PL/SQL allows you to mix SQL statements with procedural constructs. 
PL/SQL provides the capability to define and execute PL/SQL program units such as procedures, functions, and packages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SQL vs MYSQL
7. SQL vs NoSQL

NoSQL
Non-relational or distributed database system.
They have a dynamic schema
These databases are not so good for complex queries
Horizontally scalable
Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)
Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc

SQL
Vertically scalable
Fixed schema
Follows ACID
Good for complex queries
Example MySQL, Oracle SQL etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What are BASE propertied?
set of principles that guide the design and operation of modern databases. 
Basically Available
	respond to user requests
Soft State
	state of the database can change over time, even without any explicit user intervention.
	effects of background processes, updates to data, and other factors.
	designed to handle this change gracefully, and ensure that it does not lead to data corruption or loss.
Eventual Consistency
	converge to a consistent state,
handle large amounts of data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. what is a data model?
It provides the conceptual tools for describing the design of a database

Relational data model
ER Data model -> data as objects
	Entity
	relationship
	attributes
Object based data model
	functions
	encapsulation
	class
Semistructured 
	XML
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. what is an entity?
An Entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
Each student in a college is an entity.
uniquely identified by PK
Strong entity 
	Loan 
		Loan ID
		Borrower_name
		amount
		term
		rate
Weak entity 
	Depends on strong entity
	doesnt have sufficient attributes
	Paritial key
	
	Payment
		Loan ID
		Payment number
		Amount
		Payment date

Entity set
	table
	Student, customer

Types of attributes
	Simple
		atomic
		Account number
		Roll number
		first name
		age
	Composite
		Non atomic
		Name = firstname + lastname
		address = city+country+pincode
	SingleValued
		ID
		name
	Multivalued 
		Phone number
		email
		nominee
		dependent
	Derived
		Age from DOB
	NULL value
		NA
		missing entry

Relationship
	association between entity
Strong 
	between independent entity
Weak 
	between weak and strong entity
Degree
	number of entity in relationship
Unary
	Employee manages employee
Binary 
	Student takes course
Ternary
	employee works in a department
	employee works for a project

Extended ER
Specialisation
Generatlisation
Aggregation

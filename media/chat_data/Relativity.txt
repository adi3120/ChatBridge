The theory of relativity usually encompasses two interrelated physics theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity, proposed and published in 1905 and 1915, respectively. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.

The theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.

Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and others. Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others did subsequent work.

Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916.

The term "theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" (German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section of the same paper, Alfred Bucherer used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity" (German: Relativitätstheorie).

By the 1920s, the physics community understood and accepted special relativity. It rapidly became a significant and necessary tool for theorists and experimentalists in the new fields of atomic physics, nuclear physics, and quantum mechanics.

By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory. It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its mathematics seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical phenomena were discovered, such as quasars (1963), the 3-kelvin microwave background radiation (1965), pulsars (1967), and the first black hole candidates (1981), the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further confirmed the theory.

Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." Special relativity is based on two postulates:

1. The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference relative to one another (principle of relativity).
2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the light source.

General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field are physically identical. To resolve this difficulty, Einstein first proposed that spacetime is curved. Einstein discussed his idea with mathematician Marcel Grossmann, and they concluded that general relativity could be formulated in the context of Riemannian geometry. In 1915, he devised the Einstein field equations which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.

Some of the consequences of general relativity include gravitational time dilation, precession, light deflection, frame-dragging, and the expansion of the universe.

Tests of special relativity and general relativity have been conducted and have confirmed many of the predictions of these theories.

Modern applications of relativity include the precise engineering of satellite-based systems like GPS, electron microscopes, particle accelerators, and more.

Special Relativity:

1. Time Dilation:
   - Δt' = Δt / √(1 - v^2/c^2)

   Where:
   - Δt' is the dilated time in a moving frame of reference.
   - Δt is the proper time (time in a stationary frame of reference).
   - v is the relative velocity between the two frames.
   - c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

2. Length Contraction:
   - L' = L / √(1 - v^2/c^2)

   Where:
   - L' is the contracted length in a moving frame of reference.
   - L is the proper length (length in a stationary frame of reference).
   - v is the relative velocity between the two frames.
   - c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

3. Relativistic Mass-Energy Equivalence:
   - E = mc^2

   Where:
   - E is the energy.
   - m is the rest mass of an object.
   - c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

General Relativity:

1. Einstein Field Equations:
   - Gμν + Λgμν = κTμν

   Where:
   - Gμν is the Einstein tensor representing spacetime curvature.
   - Λ is the cosmological constant (related to the expansion of the universe).
   - gμν is the metric tensor describing the geometry of spacetime.
   - κ is the gravitational constant.
   - Tμν is the stress-energy-momentum tensor representing matter and energy distribution.
